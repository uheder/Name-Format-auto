# Name-Format-auto
Auto name format program with Python
Design for setting the name on excel files to be on the format of dd/mm/yyyy for all the files on the folder

This program gets inputs from the user as to which month and year it should use, and what folder the files to be renamed should be.
The program will then rename all the files with an extension of either .xls or .xlsx and only them, starting with 01/mm/yyyy to the last file on the folder

Inputs that are not on this format will not be accepted.

TODO: check for no files / no excel files on the path folder
